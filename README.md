# Idea
New words are always what slows you down the most when trying to read a language that you are learning.

So, I wrote this program in order to find words I likey don't know before reading something, by searching a text for the rarest words according to a Spanish word frequency list generated from a corpora of text.

I use this in conjunction with 
- [AutoAnkiData](https://github.com/RRomreoJr/AutoAnkiData), a project I made to more quickly gather data for new flashcards
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (an SRS flashcard program) to filter out any words I'm already studying
