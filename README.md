<b>Finds uncommon Spanish words and outputs to them to a .csv</b>

## Idea

New words are always what slows down the most when trying to read a language you are learning.

So, I wrote this program in order to prepare myself before reading something, by learning the words that are new to me first.

## Installation Instructions

1. Install Python (at least version 3.9.6).
   OR
   Activate your Python virtual environment if you have one you want to use.
2. Clone this to the folder you want to use it in. Either with git clone or downloading the .zip file and extracting.
3. Run `set_up.bat`.
